1. **YouTube Video API**  
   Fetches the most popular videos in a specific region.  
   ```javascript
   export const YOUTUBE_VIDEO_API = `https://youtube.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?part=snippet%2CcontentDetails%2Cstatistics&maxResults=50&chart=mostPopular&regionCode=IN&key=${process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY}`;
2. **YouTube Search Suggestion API**  
   Provides real-time search suggestions based on the user's query.  
   ```javascript
   export const YOUTUBE_SEARCH_API = "http://suggestqueries.google.com/complete/search?client=firefox&ds=yt&q=";

3. **YouTube Search API**  
   Fetches video search results based on user queries.  
   ```javascript
   export const YOUTUBE_SEARCH_API_VALUE = `https://youtube.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search?part=snippet&safeSearch=strict&type=videos&videoCaption=any&videoType=any&key=${process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY}`;
